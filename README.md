# AppSec Review Lab

[![CI](https://github.com/LevaAverGit/appsec-review-lab-v2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LevaAverGit/appsec-review-lab-v2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A controlled lab demonstrating 8 common web vulnerabilities with secure counterparts, SAST/DAST checks, and structured reporting — mapped to both the [OWASP Top 10](docs/OWASP_MAPPING.md) and the [OWASP API Security Top 10](docs/API_SECURITY.md) (BOLA, BFLA, Mass Assignment, SSRF).

Built to demonstrate AppSec awareness, secure coding, and Python backend skills at a junior/junior+ level. Not a production security tool.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- **7 vulnerability pairs** — each vulnerability has an intentionally flawed endpoint and a secure counterpart with an explicit fix
- **OWASP Top 10 (2021)** — 7 of 10 categories covered: A01, A03 (twice), A05 (twice), A07, A10
- **SAST checks** — regex pattern scanner that finds dangerous coding patterns in Python source
- **DAST checks** — in-process payload tests that probe running endpoints with attack payloads
- **Structured reporting** — Markdown and JSON AppSec reports with findings model (Finding, AppSecReport)
- **FastAPI backend** — Pydantic v2 models, JWT auth, multipart file upload, parameterized queries
- **159 tests, 0 failures** — TestClient, tmp_path DB isolation, no mocks
- **15 docs** — PRD, threat model, secure code review, remediation guide, interview notes, and more

## Quickstart

```bash
# Python 3.11+ required
python3.11 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Or with make
make install

# Run all tests
make test

# Start API
make run-api
# http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs
```

---

## Demo: SQL Injection

```bash
# Tautology — returns all rows
curl "http://localhost:8001/vulnerable/search?q=' OR '1'='1"

# UNION injection — dumps user credentials
curl "http://localhost:8001/vulnerable/search?q=' UNION SELECT id,username,password_hash FROM users --"

# Same payload on secure endpoint — returns empty list (parameterized query)
curl "http://localhost:8001/secure/search?q=' OR '1'='1"
```

| Module | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `test_sql_injection.py` | Tautology, UNION, destructive payloads; parameterized query safe |
| `test_idor.py` | Cross-user access on vulnerable; ownership enforcement on secure |
| `test_jwt.py` | Forged token, expired token accepted/rejected; exp claim enforced |
| `test_ssrf.py` | Loopback, RFC1918, file://, ftp:// blocked; `_is_safe_url` unit tests |
| `test_xss.py` | Script tag stored raw vs escaped; CSP header present |
| `test_file_upload.py` | Extension whitelist; path traversal prevention; size limit |
| `test_security_misc.py` | Debug exposes secrets vs returns 404 |
| `test_sast_checks.py` | Pattern detection; finding fields; real route file comparison |
| `test_dast_checks.py` | All 7 check functions; run_all_checks result set |
| `test_report_service.py` | Finding fields; markdown sections; API endpoints |

## What This Is Not

- Not a production application
- Not a real vulnerability scanner (SAST/DAST checks are heuristic demonstrations)
- Not a replacement for Semgrep, Bandit, OWASP ZAP, or Burp Suite
- All exploit-style tests target the local in-process lab application only — no external hosts are contacted

---

## Limitations

See `docs/LIMITATIONS.md`. Key points:

- All data is synthetic — no real systems involved
- SAST patterns are regex-based and will miss obfuscated code
- No coverage of CSRF, XXE, deserialization, timing attacks
- Upload directory is not cleaned up automatically

---

## Skills Demonstrated

See `docs/SKILLS_MAPPING.md` for a full competency mapping.

Demonstrates junior/junior+ readiness for AppSec engineering and secure Python backend tasks:

- Python 3.11, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLite, pytest
- OWASP Top 10 (2021) practical knowledge
- Vulnerable vs secure code pairs with explicit mitigations
- JWT implementation (weak and secure)
- SSRF guard implementation
- Heuristic SAST and DAST tooling
- Structured AppSec reporting
